			Chapter 1

Ryn slid open the glass door and stepped out onto the spacious patio.

It was a beautiful day, comfortably warm without a cloud in the sky.  The elegantly paved terrace was bathed in sunlight.

She both smiled and sighed with delight as the golden light washed over her.
It energised her.

She couldn't have planned it better.

She glanced around at the city's uneven tooth-like skyline then peered over the polished steel and glass railing at the crowded streets dozens of stories below.  For the moment she was happy to be isolated in her own private, luxurious little oasis.

She'd earned it.

On the inside of the railing there were shallow flowerbeds  overflowing with a tufted, grass like plant, while in the corners of the terrace there were large terracotta pots housing flourishing shrubs.  In the most sheltered corner there was something completely different, something that really shouldn't be there at all, a Japanese cherry blossom which against all probability was perfectly happy in the warmer climate and endlessly in bloom.

Ryn plucked one of the flowers and inhaled its rich aroma, as she did every morning.  It was her favourite scent.  She wasn't the tallest person, standing just over five foot and although the tree wasnâ€™t overly large she still needed to stretch.  Her pale skin was flawless and her luminous emerald eyes a perfect match for her carrot red tresses.  Like the cherry blossom she was beautiful beyond description and had a figure any model would kill for.
